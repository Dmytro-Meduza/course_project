Super-Resolution with Deep Learning
This project implements a deep learning-based Super-Resolution model to enhance the resolution of low-quality images. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual blocks and perceptual loss, the model transforms low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) images. The project is designed to be trained and tested on the DIV2K dataset.

Features

  * High-quality image upscaling: Enhance image resolution using deep learning.
  * Residual connections: Improve training stability and performance with residual blocks.
  * Perceptual loss: Use VGG16-based perceptual loss to preserve finer image details.
  * Data augmentation: Automatically augment training data for better generalization.
  * Comparison with traditional methods: Compare Super-Resolution results with cubic interpolation.

How to Run

  1. Upload the DIV2K dataset to Google Drive:
    * Place the dataset in a folder called DIV2K.
    * Ensure subfolders DIV2K_train_HR and DIV2K_valid_HR exist with high-resolution images.
  2. Run the project in Google Colab:
    * Open the provided Jupyter notebook.
    * Mount Google Drive to access the dataset.
    * Follow the structured steps to load data, train the model, and evaluate results.
  3. Train the model:
    * The model trains for 50 epochs with early stopping and validation monitoring.
    * Training loss and validation loss are plotted for visualization.
  4. Save and load the model:
    * The trained model is saved to Google Drive in .keras format for future use.
    * Example:
      model.save("/content/drive/My Drive/Trained_Models/super_resolution_model.keras")
  5. Test the model:
    * Compare Super-Resolution results with traditional interpolation (e.g., cubic interpolation).
    * Visualize and analyze the results.
